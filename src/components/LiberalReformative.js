            We are a proud California Community College startup, rooted in the values of equity,
            integrity, and justice. Founded at MiraCosta Community College, we are a team of dedicated
            lawyers and journalistsâ€”each a product of the California Community College system. We aim
            to demonstrate that excellence in advocacy and journalism can come from accessible education
            and progressive values.
